Infinite-Adventure
==================

A bold (and probably doomed) attempt at making an RPG in Python, iteratively. For the learning of it. 

To do:
    
    1. (Remove Mouse cursor) DONE
    2. (Add wall collision) DONE
    3. Add collision objects.
    4. Fix the damn playersprite.
    5. Add enemy NPCs.
    6. Add powers.
    7. Add a rudimentary GUI.
    8. Add leveling up.
    9. Add a rudimentary inventory and purchase system.
